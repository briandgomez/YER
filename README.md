### Usage
To start the application type the following command in the main directory: `npm start` 

### Future Additions
I plan on adding the following to the application:
1. A 'Discussion' tab where users can discuss about their favorite project
2. When a 'card' is clicked on a new page will open displaying more information such as ratings, casts, and trailers for the particular project
